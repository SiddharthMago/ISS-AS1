            In the moonlit glow of evening's embrace,
            Where stars dance softly, leaving trails of grace,
            There walks a soul, Siddharth, serene and bright,
            In his heart, love's melody takes flight.
            
            His eyes, like pools of liquid dawn,
            Reflect the beauty where dreams are drawn.
            In every step, a whisper of romance,
            As if the universe itself enchants his dance.
            
            Oh Siddharth, with heart so pure,
            In your presence, love finds its cure.
            With each gentle smile, you paint the sky,
            And in your laughter, echoes of joy fly high.
            
            May love's sweet whispers guide your way,
            And fill your every moment, night and day.
            For in your friendship, there blooms a tale,
            Of love's enduring power, never to pale.
            
            So let the stars above bear witness true,
            To the friendship shared, so deep and true.
            For in Siddharth's heart, love finds its home,
            Forever cherished, wherever you may roam.
